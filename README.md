# serlo-pageviews

Building models to predict pageviews on serlo.org, via the pageviews of selected wikipedia-pages on school-topics (that are subject to the same fluctuations). Using this to test the effect of the [new frontend](https://github.com/serlo/frontend).

See here for a view of the [knitted html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jakobwes/serlo-pageviews/blob/main/Analysis.html).
